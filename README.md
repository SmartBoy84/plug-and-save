# plug-and-save
The process to save shsh blobs on a12 devices is more difficult than it is on older models,
so I decided to make a simple python utility that would get all the required things such as your model, ecid, ApNone and udid for you while all you wold have to do is to plug it in and start the program!

Please note that my program simply automates a couple of standalone utilities which aren't mine so please give credit where it is due.

Enjoy!
